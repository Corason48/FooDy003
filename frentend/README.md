FooDy003 is a deep learning–powered next.js application for food image classification, integrating TinyVGG, GoogLeNet, and Vision Transformer (ViT) models.
The project demonstrates how modern convolutional and transformer-based architectures can be predected and deployed through an interactive Next.js interface.
